# Advent of code 2022 ðŸŽ„

This repo contains my solutions to the 2022 coding challenges of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)

It's not much, but it's honest fun ðŸ˜‰

## How to run?

Run `npm install` once after checking out the project.

Compile and run the typescript files like this:

```sh
npx tsc 01.ts && node 01.js
```

or run

```sh
npm run start 01
```
